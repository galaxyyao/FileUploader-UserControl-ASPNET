FileUploader-UserControl-ASPNET
===============================

An ASP.NET file uploader user control. Based mainly on pluploader(http://www.plupload.com/).

...well, although I'm not willing to use flash, but it seems to be the only simple solution to make a fileuploader user control. And it can pass browser compatibility test (Tested on IE8, IE10, IE11, Chrome(latest), Firefox(latest)).

I'm not sure why there's no mature open source fileuploader for ASP.NET. So I made it myself.

Steps you only need to do:
1. Include jquery & plupload folder
2. Include FileUploader.ascx
3. Add user control header and user control in aspx file
4. set its properties
Done.
